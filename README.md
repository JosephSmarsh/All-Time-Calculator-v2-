# All-Time-Calculator-v2-
Currently developing the returnDaysPassed() function to include all 12 months

To Be Done:
  -Develop a function to return the amount of days left in the year... For example if it is Jan, 1 there are 365 days left (include current day)
  -Develop a function to Calculate the new date by adding a fixed number of days to the date. For example, if the date is 3-18-2017 and the days to be added are 25, the new date is 4-12-2017.
